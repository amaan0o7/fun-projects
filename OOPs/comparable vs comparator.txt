notes
-> List of Integer, String, Boolean, double, float char can be sorted because these can be compared to each other
-> PriorityQueue of Integer, String, Boolean, double, float, char will work because these can be compared to each other
-> Sort (Collections.sort / Arrays.sort or PriorityQueue or TreeSet or TreeMap) won't work for normal classes
-> Error = can't typecast <current class> to comparable
-> What is comparable?
-> comparable is an interface?
    -> What is an interface?
    -> Interface is a contract of fns, which any class that implements the interface has to honor (the contract)
    -> Class implementing the interface has to provide body of fns
-> What does comparable interface contain?
    -> only one fn -> int compareTo(T o)
-> How is comparable interface special
    -> it is java's designated interface meant to implement comparisons
    -> Used by any java code which uses comparisons
        -> PriorityQueue, TreeMap, TreeSet, Arrays.sort, Collections.sort, Collections.min, Collections.max
-> How to implement comparable?
    -> write the body of int compareTo(T other) fn
        -> if you think, this < other, return -ve values
        -> if you think, this == other, return 0
        -> if you think, this > other, return +ve
-> Increasing = this.p - other.p
-> Decreasing = other.p - this.p
-> Multiple parameters e.g. sort l1 of cars on speed and l2 of cars on price
